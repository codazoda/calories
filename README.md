## Why did you create TryMe?

I recently enrolled in the Startup School for Future Founders course offered by YC. One of the pieces of advice they give is that your product launch isn't a one single event and that you should launch over and over again.

I've set myself a goal to launch 52 times in 2021. That's one launch a week for the entire year. I have half a dozen products I've launched in the past and I plan to create other products throughout the course of the year. Every week, I'll try some form of a new launch.

A lot of the products I create are web apps so I'll probably be creating web app landing pages over and over again with various little tweaks each time. I decided to create TryMe to create those initial landing pages quickly.

## What is this neat.css file?

The TryMe design is based on [Neat CSS](https://neat.joeldare.com), my opinionated minimalist CSS framework.
